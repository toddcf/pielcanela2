			<main class="col span-2-of-3 bio">

				<p>Brenda Canela, CMT studied massage therapy at California Healing Arts College (CHAC) in West Los Angeles, CA. While she excels in deep tissue work, the nurturing factor of Prenatal Massage inspired her to continue coursework through the Institute of Somatic Therapy and earn her certification.</p>

				<p>Always looking to further her skill set, she trained with Tina Allen, founder and director of Liddle Kidz Foundation, and became internationally certified as an Infant Massage Teacher. She also received an international certification for Pediatric Massage, and further training for Touch Therapy for Childhood Cancer.</p>

				<p>She is CPR, AED, and First Aid certified by The American Heart Association and is an insured member of Associated Bodywork&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Massage Professionals (ABMP).</p>

				<p>Prior to only working her private practice, Brenda worked at a spa where she was awarded the 2012 Therapist of the Year. She was also a featured Massage Therapist in the spaâ€™s monthly newsletter. Here are some highlights:</p>

				<p><h2>What made you decide to get into massage?</h2></p>
				<p>When I was first introduced to massage, I didn't know ALL of the health benefits. I simply wanted to relax after a long day at my desk. However, when regular massage sessions relieved me of years of debilitating migraines, I was hooked. I grew interested and appreciated all of the natural benefits in the work. I wanted to be a part of that.</p>

				<p><h2>Why do you enjoy doing massage?</h2></p>
				<p>Massage is very personal. Each client is a different experience. The client trusts their therapist to cater to their needs, whether it be stress, an injury, or chronic pain. It's a great feeling to know you were able to deliver. A client once sent me a message hours later that I'll never forget. It said, &quot;I'm actually feeling joy about cooking dinner right now. A feeling I haven't had in a very long time. I missed it. I turned on music and danced a while. Thank you for the breath of life.&quot; The body heals itself. I only do what I can to facilitate that.</p>

				<p>Massage and bodywork are also mentally stimulating for me. I, too, gain peace and balance while focused on the work I do, and that clarity allows for inspiration and enthusiasm. Win&ndash;win.</p>

				<p><h2>Anything else you would like our readers to know about you?</h2></p>
				<p>I've been an actor for about 18 years now. I fell in love with it in high school and was ridiculously fortunate enough to land my first agent then. I received my BA in Theater Arts from Loyola Marymount University and continued to work in film, television, commercials, theater and voice-over.</p>

				<div class="massage-benefits">
					
					<p>Experts estimate that upward of ninety percent of disease is stress-related. And perhaps nothing ages us faster&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;internally and externally&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;than high stress. Massage is an effective tool for managing this stress, and can also help specifically address a number of health issues. Bodywork can:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Decrease anxiety and depression.</li>
						<li>Enhance sleep quality.</li>
						<li>Increase energy.</li>
						<li>Improve concentration.</li>
						<li>Alleviate low-back pain and improve range of motion.</li>
						<li>Assist with shorter, easier labor for expectant mothers and shorten maternity hospital stays.</li>
						<li>Ease medication dependence.</li>
						<li>Enhance immunity by stimulating lymph flow&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;the body's natural defense system.</li>
						<li>Exercise and stretch weak, tight, or atrophied muscles.</li>
						<li>Help athletes of any level prepare for&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and recover from&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;strenuous workouts.</li>
						<li>Improve the condition of the body's largest organ&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;the skin.</li>
						<li>Increase joint flexibility.</li>
						<li>Promote tissue regeneration, reducing scar tissue and stretch marks.</li>
						<li>Pump oxygen and nutrients into tissues and vital organs, improving circulation.</li>
						<li>Reduce postsurgery adhesions and swelling.</li>
						<li>Reduce spasms and cramping.</li>
						<li>Relax and soften injured, tired, and overused muscles.</li>
						<li>Release endorphins&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;amino acids that work as the body's natural painkiller.</li>
						<li>Relieve migraine pain.</li>

				<!-- JON F. -->
				<div class="flex-items" id="jon-f">
					<blockquote cite="#">&quot;Brenda works miracles! After my lower back went out, I could barely stand or walk without excruciating pain. Halfway through our session, I felt all the pain leave my body and experienced relief for the first time in days. Since the massage I have experienced significantly reduced pain and a huge increase in mobility. To anyone who is suffering chronic pain, Brenda truly can help you. In my case, she has earned a client for life!&quot;</blockquote>

				<!-- TANIA TAPIA -->
				<div class="flex-items" id="tania">
					<blockquote cite="#">&quot;I have had many massages of varying specialties and I have never had such an incredibly positive and full experience. I could have stayed on that table forever! It is difficult to find someone who provides good, strong pressure when you need it and doesn't make you feel like they are going to hurt your spine. She finds that balance and allows you to communicate the pressure you need. Brenda did such an incredibly thorough job that the hour spent felt like two hours of heaven! I highly recommend her! She is great for helping you relax, softening tense muscles from sports, and even balancing your energy. What a complete and wonderful experience. I have already preset my monthly appointments!&quot;</blockquote>

				<!-- AMELIA DE LA MORA -->
				<div class="flex-items" id="amelia">
					<blockquote cite="#">&quot;Brenda is a really great massage therapist. She may be little, but she is strong! In all sincerity, she helped me with a condition called Bells Palsy, which causes paralyzed nerves in half of your face. I had the condition for over a year when I started seeing her, and she really helped loosen the muscles up and alleviate soreness. She took time to research the condition, learn about what areas and points would be the best to work. She really cared about my improvement. I can tell she takes pride in her work, and her personality is truly one of the best to be around. She is very positive and just a little bit hilarious. I recommend her 100%.&quot;</blockquote>

				<!-- JONATHAN W. -->
				<div class="flex-items" id="jonathan">
					<blockquote cite="#">&quot;Brenda's abilities always exceed my expectations. She provides a top quality massage experience and is able to flow seamlessly between the soothing and therapeutic. She can easily tailor a massage to specific needs and has the intuitive ability to find things that you weren't aware of previously. Most of all, I come away from the experience feeling much better than I did before. I will re-book with Brenda!&quot;</blockquote>

				<!-- TODD L. -->
				<div class="flex-items" id="todd-l">
					<blockquote cite="#">&quot;I'm ticklish, and because of that, I often find myself staying away from things like massages. However, I was really glad I went to Brenda. She did a great job of alleviating any and all stiffness in my back and legs, and I didn't find myself snickering even once.  For those that think a girl can't apply enough pressure, think again. She is one tough lady that knows her pressure points. I have never been a regular with massage therapy, but I think that changes from here on forward&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;</blockquote>

				<!-- DANIA R. -->
				<div class="flex-items" id="dania">
					<blockquote cite="#">&quot;My session with Brenda is a session complete with therapy, comedy, and a bit of a musical serenade&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Oh, and somewhere in that hour is a fantastic massage that makes my muscles melt into manipulable submission.  Brenda's massages leave my body and my mind clear and refreshed not only for that particular day, but the few days that follow. Kinks and tweaks dissipate under her focused firm hands and sometimes a necessary elbow.  My monthly appointment with Brenda is that time of the month I actually look forward to.&quot;</blockquote>

				<!-- TERESA VALENZUELA -->
				<div class="flex-items" id="teresa">
					<blockquote cite="#">&quot;Whenever I experience the warmth of Brenda's hands it feels like heaven&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;an hour massage turns into a timeless and ongoing restful summer's day&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;my achy muscles melt, my pain and stress disappear&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;replaced only by soothing tenderness. Brenda's warmth, genuine passion and care for massaging come through every time.&quot;</blockquote>

				<!-- TODD C-F -->
				<div class="flex-items" id="tcf">
					<blockquote cite="#">&quot;I'm not typically one to get massages, but with Brenda it's different. She knows how to calibrate to my level of comfort and create a great experience for me.  Plus, when I got off her table, all that tension in my neck and shoulders was finally gone!&quot;</blockquote>
