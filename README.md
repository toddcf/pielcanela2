## Technologies Used

## Current Iteration:

### All

1. Why has the white space to the right of the entire site returned?? It's only on index.html, not the other pages.
2. Links: Style all links and hover effects throughout entire website.
3. Buttons:
  1. Make sure text never extends outside of the buttons as screen width shrinks.
    1. Infant Massage card: Button texts spill over on some of the WIDER screen sizes.
    2. Group Rates: SCHEDULE NOW text should shrink at the smallest screen size.
    3. Schedule Now: CLICK HERE FOR NEW CLIENT FORMS spills over.
    4. Cancellation Policy modal: Stack the buttons.
    5. Travel Policy modal: Stack the buttons.
  2. Remove Bootstrap's blue outline that appears automatically after button is clicked.
4. Add social links to footer of each section.
  1. Vertically center the "Join Us" text.
5. Optional: Add and position all up and down chevrons.
