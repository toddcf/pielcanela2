2. Links: Style all links and hover effects throughout entire website.
3. Buttons:
  1. Make sure text never extends outside of the buttons as screen width shrinks.
    1. Group Rates: SCHEDULE NOW text should shrink at the smallest screen size.
  2. Remove Bootstrap's blue outline that appears automatically after button is clicked.
4. Add social links to footer of each section.
  1. Vertically center the "Join Us" text.
5. Optional: Add and position all up and down chevrons.
