## Technologies Used

- HTML5.
- CSS3.
- Bootstrap 4 Beta.
- JavaScript.
- jQuery.

## Current Iteration:

### All

1. Remove white space at top and right of screen. Should not be able to scroll to the right.
2. Each section-footer: Correctly position the SCHEDULE NOW button (and the social links).
3. Confirm font.
4. Add and position all up and down chevrons.
5. Fit "Piel Canela Massage Therapy" on one line on most screen sizes. (Make responsive.)
6. Make POLICIES a modal.
7. Make H1s for each section responsive -- the text should get smaller as the screen width shrinks instead of being cut off.

### Nav

1. When expanded (xl and larger), nav-items should not take up multiple lines of text. See https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/typography/#responsive-typography.
2. If possible, have SCHEDULE NOW link always visible in nav.
3. Align dropdown nav-items to the right.
4. Add hover effects to svg (if possible) and text below the logo, so users know it's a link.

### Hero

1. Reduce the amount of time before the H1 animation descends.
2. Replace bg image with a video (once we have the video).

### About the Therapist

1. Remove rounded corners on image.

### Benefits of Massage

1. Content: Overcome objections.
2. Content: Why Brenda is the best massage therapist for them.

### Testimonials

1. Test flexbox at all screen sizes.
2. Make cards transparent. Add border. Make sure they're still readable.

### Services and Rates

1. Center all SCHEDULE NOW and LEARN MORE buttons on each card.
   1. Also, remove the border that appears when you click on a button.
   2. Should INFANT MASSAGE's "Learn More" open a modal or a separate page?
2. GROUPS:
  1. Make this card its own flexbox so that OFFICE and PARTIES can go side-by-side on wide screens and stack vertically on small screens.
  2. Make POLICIES link stand out even when not hovering.
3. Test flexbox at all screen sizes.
4. Payments:
  1. Center each payment icon inside its column div. (Accomplishing this should make their spacing look right at all screen widths.)
  2. animate.css each payment logo, one after another.

### Schedule Now / Contact / Client Forms

1. Email Form:
  1. Add labels, but maybe don't display them. (For ADA purposes only.)
  2. Improve the styling.
  3. Link to actual email system and test it. (Must deploy in order to test.)
2. Add button link to client forms as separate PDF pages -- and center the button within its column.

### Footer

- N/A

### FAQ Page

1. Plain English.
2. Use Bootstrap 4's expand and hide features. (And automatically close one answer when a different question is clicked.)

### Gift Certificates Page

1. Use a lightbox to display images of the gift certificates (front and back) when clicked.

### Policies (Modal AND Separate Page)

## Final Checks

1. Make sure the following are visible against all their various backgrounds:
  1. Chevrons
  2. Nav Icon
  3. Piel Canela Massage Therapy Logo
  4. Social Media Icons
2. Test mobile responsiveness.

## Deployment

1. Test deploy to Heroku.
2. Get confirmation from Brenda.
3. Deploy to GoDaddy.
4. Have GoDaddy link the old URL to the new URL (instead of the other way around, like it is now).

## Future Iterations:

1. Set active class on nav to whichever section you're viewing.
2. Create MailChimp list and add signup form (and icon) to this website.
