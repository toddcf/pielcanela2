## Technologies Used

- HTML5.
- CSS3.
- Bootstrap 4 Beta.
- JavaScript.
- jQuery.

## Current Iteration:

### All

1. Why has the white space to the right of the entire site returned?? It's only on index.html, not the other pages.

### Hero (Header)

- Done!

### Nav

1. Add hover effects to SVG (if possible) so users know it's a link.

### About the Therapist

- Done!

### Benefits of Massage

1. Each benefit card should fade in using Waypoints when the user scrolls down.

### Testimonials

- Done!

### Services and Rates

1. Once the INFANT MASSAGE page is ready, link to that and delete the modal.
2. PAYMENTS card:
  1. animate.css and Waypoints each logo, one after another.
3. Make each card pop up into frame when user scrolls down, using Waypoints and animate.css.


### Schedule Now / Contact / Client Forms

1. Button: "Click Here For New Client Forms" text is not responding to font-size changes. (Try overflow wrap: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow-wrap)
2. Email Form:
  1. Add labels, but don't display them. (For ADA purposes only.)
  2. Link to actual email system and test it. (Must deploy in order to test.)

### Footer

- Done!

### Client Forms

- Done!

### FAQ Page

- Done!

### Gift Certificates Page

- Done!

### Infant Massage Page

1. Need content from Brenda to create this page.

### Policies Page

- ADD: Massage Certifications
- ADD: Insurance
- ADD: Links to client forms as separate PDF pages.

## Final Checks

1. Test mobile responsiveness.

## Deployment

1. Get confirmation from Brenda.
2. Deploy to GoDaddy.
3. Have GoDaddy link the old URL to the new URL (instead of the other way around, like it is now).

## Future Iterations:

1. Set active class on nav to whichever section you're viewing.
2. Once a nav-item is clicked, the nav should collapse. (Can do this, but it creates a glitch that scrolls to the middle of a section, not the top of a section.)
3. Create MailChimp list and add signup form (and icon) to this website.
