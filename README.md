## Technologies Used

- HTML5.
- CSS3.
- Bootstrap 4 Beta.
- JavaScript.
- jQuery.

## Current Iteration:

### All

1. Links: Style all links and hover effects throughout entire website.
1. Buttons:
  1. Make sure text never extends outside of the buttons as screen width shrinks (especially in SERVICES section).
  2. Remove Bootstrap's blue outline that appears automatically after button is clicked.
2. Add social links to footer of each section.
  1. Vertically center the "Join Us" text.
3. Optional: Add and position all up and down chevrons.

### Hero (Header)

1. Replace bg image with a video (once we have the video).
2. I removed the white margin on top of HERO by manually adding `margin-top: -30px;`, but I shouldn't have to do that. Figure out what is wrong.

### Nav

1. Add hover effects to svg (if possible) and text below the logo, so users know it's a link.
2. Connect all links to other pages (once those pages are created).
3. Once a nav-item is clicked, the nav should collapse.

### About the Therapist

N/A

### Benefits of Massage

1. Each benefit card should fade in using Waypoints when the user scrolls down.
2. Content: Overcome objections.
3. Content: Why Brenda is the best massage therapist for them.

### Testimonials

N/A

### Services and Rates

1. Style all services cards.
  1. Should INFANT MASSAGE's "Learn More" open a modal or a separate page?
  2. GROUPS card:
    1. Make POLICIES link stand out even when not hovering.
  3. PAYMENTS card:
    1. animate.css each logo, one after another.
  4. Make each card pop up into frame when user scrolls down, using Waypoints and animate.css.


### Schedule Now / Contact / Client Forms

1. Fix hover effect on phone number. (Don't turn blue when hovering. Always underline so people know it can be clicked.)
2. Email Form:
  1. Add labels, but don't display them. (For ADA purposes only.)
  2. Improve the styling.
  3. Link to actual email system and test it. (Must deploy in order to test.)
3. Add link to client forms page with separate PDFs (once that page is created).

### Footer

- N/A

### Client Forms

- N/A

### FAQ Page

1. Plain English.
2. Use Bootstrap 4's expand and hide features. (And automatically close one answer when a different question is clicked.)

### Gift Certificates Page

2. Style phone number hover effects, etc.

### Policies (Modal AND Separate Page)
  
- ADD: Massage Certifications

- MODAL: Fix styling of "See Full Policy Document" button.

## Final Checks

1. Make sure the following are visible against all their various backgrounds:
  1. Chevrons
  2. Social Media Icons
2. Test mobile responsiveness.

## Deployment

1. Test deploy to Heroku.
2. Get confirmation from Brenda.
3. Deploy to GoDaddy.
4. Have GoDaddy link the old URL to the new URL (instead of the other way around, like it is now).

## Future Iterations:

1. Set active class on nav to whichever section you're viewing.
2. Create MailChimp list and add signup form (and icon) to this website.
